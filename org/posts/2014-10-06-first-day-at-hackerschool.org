I managed to get into the Fall batch from Hacker School.
Lots of things to focus on!

Some links:

- [[https://twitter.com/cristalopes][Crista Lopes]] talk from StrangeLoop about [[http://www.infoq.com/presentations/style-methodology][programming styles]], which
  are in the end nothing but constraints.
  (I was there at that StrangeLoop but somehow missed the talk...)

- And accompanying exercises
  <https://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style>

- Talk on Monads in Haskell, (there are Haskell books everywhere...)
  + <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad>
  + Styles [[https://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style/tree/master/09-the-one][#9]] and [[https://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style/tree/master/24-quarantine][#24]] from Crista's book.

- SICP
  + Morning group to cover it.
  + Version of the book at: [[http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/]]
