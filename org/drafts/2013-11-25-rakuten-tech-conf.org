Last month, I gave presentation at the
[[http://tech.rakuten.co.jp/][Rakuten Tech Conf]] to talk a little bit of how it has resulted to us
having an internal platform as a service to make teams

After watching the video, I see that I had a lot of misplaced
confidence with the English I speak... I'm mispronouncing tons of words
and overall I think there is a lot of room to improve...

In the end, it was a good experience to give this talk,
and felt that it would be worth trying to get better at this
by doing it more often. Need to get out of my comfort zone and maybe
try doing these sort of things at local meetups.

The video of the talk has been finally been uploaded and can be
watched here:
