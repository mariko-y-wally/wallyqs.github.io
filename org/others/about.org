Hi, my name is Waldemar Quevedo (nickname: Wally) <br />

I do Dev&amp;Ops at Rakuten in the Platform as a Service team in Tokyo, where I have focused
on solving <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rakutentech/fluentd-meetup-logging-infrastructure-in-paa-s">logging related issues</a>
as well as Ruby support.

I'm also a contributor and current maintainer of the <a href="https://github.com/bdewey/org-ruby">org-ruby</a> gem,
in case you find some functionality missing please issue a ticket <a href="https://github.com/bdewey/org-ruby/issues">here</a>
please.
