- We sync the current writings.

*Note:* Remember changes in the =src= directory are meant to be
ephemeral and we should mostly rely on the tangling.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rsync -avz org/posts/ src/_posts/

# TODO: not rendered
# rsync -avz org/others/about.org src/about.org
#+END_SRC

- Build the site and test locally.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir src
bundle exec jekyll build  -d ../site/
