#+TITLE:	Started to blog with Jekyll
#+CATEGORY:	posts
#+LAYOUT:	post

Starting a blog using the [[https://github.com/holman/left][Left]] theme for [[https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll][Jekyll]].

Compared to other solutions, this uses the =org-ruby= parser
to export =.org= files into HTML. You can check the source 
for this site here: <https://github.com/wallyqs/wallyqs.github.io>

#+begin_src ruby :results output
puts "Syntax highlighting works!"
#+end_src

There are still some pending things that I would like to improve:

- Use the [[https://github.com/wallyqs/re-org][re-org]] tool to create and organize the posts that 
  would finally go into the =_posts= directory for publishing.
  I think in the end using a YAML file would have been better than
  having to use environment variables.

- Try to extend or patch Jekyll so that I can avoid having to write:

  #+begin_src conf
  ---
  layout: post
  title:  Hello world
  category: posts
  ---
  #+end_src

  And instead cover this with Org syntax like:
  
  #+begin_src conf
  #+layout:   post
  #+title:    Hello world
  #+category: posts
  #+end_src

Other than that, the setup promises to be very comfortable for
writing, I'll see how it goes.
