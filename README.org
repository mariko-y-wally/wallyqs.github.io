#+TITLE: Literate infrastructure site

*** How to generate the site

To generate the site we can use the =org-converge= gem:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
gem install org-converge
org-run org/publishing/initial-setup.org
org-run org/publishing/build.org
#+END_SRC

Then to deploy to Github pages:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
org-run org/publishing/deploy.org
#+END_SRC

If not using the gem, the instructions described in the Org mode
files can could help, read in order as stated above.
